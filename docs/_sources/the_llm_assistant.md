# The role of the llm assistant

__Definition of the situation, problem and solution__

## Reporting volunteer observations

Alot of ink has been spilled on the topic of citizen science and the role of volunteers in data collection. We assume that a 
a reasonable person would place value on the collective observations of a segment of the population in reference to a particular
topic. We also assume that the value of any such collective observations is largely dependent on the method in which the 
observations were made and the transparency of the analytical process.

Beach litter data has two broad purposes: 1. To inform policy and 2. To inform the public. However, an informed policy at 
the national level is not the same at the regional level. Resource allocation and policy implementation are at the 
cantonal and municipal level. Thus, reasonable people at various levels of the administrative hierarchy may not have access to
the information needed to make informed decisions.

## Beach litter surveys

The European Environment Agency (EEA) has been working with volunteers to collect data on marine litter. The volunteers 
have been collecting data on the amount and type of litter found on beaches in Europe. The collection method is defined
in the _Guide to monitoring marine litter in European seas_. In 2020 a beach litter density threshold and method of calculation
was introduced by the EEA using the data collected by volunteers. The threshold value is based on the principal of 
precaution regarding exposure to plastics. In switzerland monitoring of shoreline litter along lakes and rivers
has followed the same protocol with minor modifications due to topography since 2015. 

## Data availability and reporting

The availability of the data is largely dependent on local NGOs and volunteers. There is no legal requirement to report litter data.
The federal report, modeled after the EEA report, provides a format and a method for aggregating and reporting but no 
infrastructure to collect and report the data. In the LÃ©man region data collection and reporting has standardized because 
of the work of local NGOs, the most recent report was published in 2024. 


## Environmental monitoring and protection

Environmental monitoring and protection are the responsibility of the cantons in Switzerland. The cantons can and do delegate
certain responsibilities to the municipalities. Thus, a report at the national level provides an overview of the situation 
but provides very little value in the way enabling action at the cantonal or municipal level. 

## Cantonal and municipal resources

Each canton and municipality has a section or department responsible for environmental pollution. These departments, for the most part,
are already working with limited resources. Managers of these departments may be more than competent in interpreting a report but lack the
additional human resources necessary to collect data and prepare reports for their own canton or municipality. The cause of this is two fold: 1. 
The lack of common infrastructure for data collection and reporting and 2. Inexperience in domain specific data handling and analysis

## The solution

We provide a solution that maximizes the efficiency of the reporting process by leveraging large language models (llms) and 
standardized scientific computing. The llm assistant produces a rough draft of the standardized report, ready to be reviewed and 
edited by the domain expert (or the responsible person). This reduces the cost to report the data and keeps a human in 
the analytical loop. More of the resources can be allocated to collection and communication of the data. Or if you look at this way, 
small investments in data collection will lead to large returns in communication at the municipal and cantonal level.

Ultimately, the goal is that those who must act to reduce pollution have the data in the format that they need to make informed 
decisions. The llm assistant  uses the current monitoring methods and the capabilities of the llms and scientific
computing to provide a solution that is both efficient, transparent and appropriate to all scales of governance and stakeholders.
