# Sustainable digitalization and digital sufficiency

Digital technology is primarily a tool: on the path to net zero, it has the potential to promote resource and energy 
efficiency as well as the circular economy, thus contributing to a CO2-neutral future. Currently, however, it is causing ever 
more emissions and consuming more energy and resources:

> The production and use of ICT are responsible for up to 4% of global emissions – a figure that is rising and equivalent
> to emissions from Japan or the entire aviation sector. Electricity demand currently accounts for 10% of global 
> consumption and could double by 2030. Data centers already consume more electricity than entire nation-states. 
> Experts predict that this will double from 2022 to 2026. Additionally, they require billions of liters of cooling water 
> and the mining of environmentally harmful minerals like lithium, cobalt, gallium, and germanium.
> The tech giant Microsoft aimed to become CO2-neutral by 2030. Due to the AI boom, it is now further away from this goal than ever before.

Efficiency improvements through digitalization and technological innovations often do not lead to reduced environmental 
impact when viewed holistically and in the long term. Sometimes, they even increase it (rebound and induction effects): 
technological savings in energy or time are offset by additional consumption. An example is mobile devices like smartphones. 
They allow consumers to shop anytime and anywhere. Since mobile shopping creates new opportunities – for example, in the middle 
of the night or while waiting at a bus stop – this is called an induction effect: the technology enables additional consumption 
that would not have occurred otherwise.

## Making Technology Part of the Solution – Not the Problem

To achieve climate goals and design digital technologies so that they work for the planet instead of against it, they 
need to become not just more efficient (“better”) and consistent (“different”) but also sufficient 
(“as much as necessary, as little as possible”).

> The prevailing strategy of using digital technologies to improve efficiency must be guided by an overarching strategy 
> of sufficiency, aimed at achieving satisfaction of needs (‘enough’) rather than ongoing increase (‘more’).“

Digital sufficiency aims to lower the absolute level of resource and energy consumption or emissions through or with 
digital technology and asks the question: How can we use digital technologies to enable a good life for all within planetary boundaries?

Digital sufficiency includes four dimensions:

1. Software sufficiency: energy-efficient and data-sparing software;
2. Hardware sufficiency: fewer devices that are longer-lasting, repairable, and upgradeable;
3. Usage sufficiency: using digital technologies to save energy and resources or to promote sufficient practices;
4. Economic sufficiency: enabling the transition to a post-growth economy with digital technologies (e.g., reduced working hours, circular economy).

### Prototypes for a More Sustainable Future

But how can more digital projects and technologies specifically help reduce Switzerland’s ecological footprint? We don’t 
have the final answer. What we do offer is a proven, methodically structured funding program that demonstrably helps 
interdisciplinary teams develop human-centered, collaborative technological solutions to complex societal problems: the Prototype Fund.

New digital solutions must already address potential negative effects during the development process. This is the only 
way to ensure that technology successfully contributes to decarbonization. With the Prototype Fund, we support projects 
at exactly this early development phase – and we want to embed sustainability and sufficiency approaches even more strongly 
into the tech community and our program structure.

We recognize that tackling the global multi-crisis requires more systemic solutions – technological progress that does 
not exceed planetary boundaries and endanger our livelihoods but operates within them. We need to move away from the 
narrative of omnipotent tech geniuses and hype technologies that solve all our problems and toward holistic, collaborative 
bottom-up solutions. Due to its unique funding structure, the Prototype Fund has great potential to support precisely 
this transformation. We want to leverage this potential together with you.
What We Fund

You can still submit Open Source software, hardware, or other projects. We explicitly encourage you to apply with 
projects that promote sustainable digitalization and digital sufficiency by other means. In case of doubt: even if code 
or hardware development plays a minor role in your project idea, you should still give it a try.

We provide space for experiments and prototypes that test sustainable and sufficient concepts in practice and have the 
potential to scale – from digital minimalism to smart resource use. Through your project ideas, we will continue to learn 
what sufficiency and sustainability can mean in the digital context.

Your project should relate to digital technology in one of the following two ways:

### Reducing technology as a problem: The project should encourage a more conscious use of digital technology (hardware and/or software) and contribute to an absolute reduction in energy/resource consumption or emissions in IT.

* How can the increasing consumption of digital products and services in Switzerland be limited?
* How can digital products, services, or platforms be designed so that operators have incentives to reduce absolute resource consumption?

### Technology as part of the solution: The project should use digital technology (hardware and/or software) to contribute to an absolute reduction in energy/resource consumption or emissions in other sectors (e.g., mobility, buildings, nutrition).

* How can digital products, services, or platforms help reduce the energy consumption and emissions of mobility?
* How can digital products, services, or platforms contribute to a shift toward more sustainable diets?

If you are unsure whether your idea fits our focus theme, feel free to contact us via email.

For inspiration, here are a few examples of existing and fictional projects. If you know of others, let us know!

* Software: Unified design standards, ad blockers, Open Source libraries, Open Data or shared data pools (e.g., mobility data) as infrastructure or for synergy use; tools that optimize code and software processes to minimize energy consumption (e.g., UPS Orion); search engines like Ecosia, which use revenue for reforestation.
* Hardware: Framework, Fairphone, Open (Source) Hardware; virtualization to use hardware more efficiently or avoid its purchase.
* Usage: Sharing platforms like Too Good To Go; tools that raise awareness (e.g., a plugin that visualizes energy consumption from browsing); technology-supported energy and resource optimization for buildings or energy management platforms for households.

The application phase runs from January 23 to March 20, 2025. Visit our Info- & Networking-Event to learn more about the theme and connect with potential collaborators. To stay updated, subscribe to our newsletter and follow us on Mastodon or LinkedIn. Together, we’ll make digital innovation in Switzerland more sustainable. We look forward to your ideas and solutions!

## Data Sufficiency

2. Usage
3. Sufficient data
4. Practical application
5. Costs and benefits

### Context: Observational studies and environmental stewardship

Observational studies attempt to draw inferences from a collection of samples that may apply to a larger population. Common
in environmental science, the data collected is used to estimate the population size of plant and animal species. and are used to monitor the environment. Here we consider a systemic approach to monitoring
and reporting plastics in the environment. With the realization that computing and network technologies are an essential part
of delivering the value from the pooled observations of stakeholders.



observed conditions.





will be returned to society in the same manner. On the other hand, a hand held device is not necessary to use the 
observations for making informed decisions. 





one very important call to the technologies that allow us to extract information
from geospatial criteria. This approach maximizes the value of local observations by facilitating the integration
of the individual participation, thus keeping the human at
center of the assessment process
of data collected by observed conditions in the madata sufficiency at the operational level with the stated goal of reducing plastics in the environment.   with a stated goal of 
plastics in the environment. T
human centered approach to environmental stewardship. Litter has many definitions. in the context of this project we are talking about 
the man-made objects that are found at the interface of the land and water, we call the litter found in this zone beach-litter. 
This zone is not only the place where we interact with the water, it is also an important source of biodiversity in freshwater 
environments and the subject of extensive research by WSL, [Blue-Green Biodiversity Research Initiative](https://www.wsl.ch/en/about-wsl/organisation/programmes-and-initiatives/blue-green-biodiversity-research-initiative/#c722342). 

When considering the presence of plastics in the environment, specifically at the beach, the EU opted for a beach-litter threshold based on the principle of precaution.

> While pollution through chemical substances typically can be based on laboratory based toxicological studies, the basic concept of dose-
> effect relationships can also be applied to beach litter, as both regard the input of chemicals or
> materials having adverse effects. Therefore, option (b), the use of low percentile values of beach litter
> on all EU beaches, was selected for development of a TV for beach litter, because it is a data-based,
> transparent and practical statistical method. [A European Threshold Value and Assessment Method for Macro Litter on Coastlines](https://publications.jrc.ec.europa.eu/repository/bitstream/JRC121707/coastline_litter_threshold_value_report_14_9_2020_final.pdf).

Recall that 99.9% of the data used to establish the threshold was collected by volunteers. These volunteers have varying levels of expertise and
experience. Earlier studies revealed that samples gathered by volunteers were similar to those gathered by professionals [Rech et all](#/weneed a link here). Because we are talking about
data sufficiency, there are no reliable vision models that identify objects in situ as well as a human. The reasons for this is the varying stages of decompostion that an object can be found in and
the visibility of the object, half buried, algae covered, etc.

### Usage: 

A beach-litter inventory is the comprehensive removal and identification of all mand made objects found for a given length of shoreline. Thus, these are simple
observations that are gathered using protocol. From the perspective of the statistician it can be described as collection of data where the mean is greater than
the median under most conditions. Subsets of the data are likely to have a variance greater than the mean, the observed distribution of the data can be described 
as Negative Binomial and the probability of exceeding a given value is well described by Beta(a,b).

If those last two sentences caused your eyes to glaze over, then you are not alone. Your use case for the data may be administrative or resource allocation.

__Administrative:__ Beach-litter data are observations of all the elements that escaped the existing waste management system. The data and its interpretation
can be used to help identify priorities and feasibility of projects. Examples:

1. We would like to conduct a prevention campaign, what do we focus on to have the greatest effect ?
2. An association would like CHF  1 000 to conduct a campaign to reduce the plastic footprint, they want to reduce the number of straws.
3. Three years ago you financed a project to reduce the plastic footprint in your region, what is the result?
4. You are looking for industry partners to educate specific domains about the plastic footprint and its effects.
5. You have a budget for 5 beach cleanup this year, where do you focus your efforts?
6. You are called to present to school children about plastics in the environment, what do you say?
7. Cigarettes and snack wrappers are approximately 20% - 30% of beach-litter, what are you going to do about the rest?

In the cases above, this data is in support of other observations or part of an overall environmental assessment. The results may
simply be summarized in an annex or one paragraph. 

__Research:__ The surrounding environment is a key factor in the distribution of beach-litter. Beach-litter density, in Switzerland, is similar for
locations that have a similar topographical profile [Near or Far](#/weneed a link here). This means we can take advantage of the different grouping
methods in ML pipelines to extend the value of local observations. Which means that we can make a reasonable estimate of what is likely to be found
given the topographical features. 

1. There is no data on a particular location, what is a reasonable estimate of what might be found?
2. Given locations with similar features what are the reasons for the differences in the amount of beach-litter? Are all objects the same?
3. Do similar locations with similar levels of investment have similar levels of beach-litter? Is this true for all types of objects?
4. What are the characteristics of mitigation and prevention projects for locations with low levels of beach-litter compared to those with high levels?
5. Are their optimal locations in the river bassin where removal operations should be focused? What role does hydrology play in this?
6. Are their design or process changes that could reduce certain types of beach-litter? Is this from production, transport or use?
7. How much beach litter do we reduce by reducing run off from the surrounding area? What is the most efficient way to do this?

In the cases above, the observations are being used as an indicator or feature variable in a much larger model. Researchers and
analysts will want consistence and reliability when selecting model parameters.

In both common use cases the data or the methods of observations are not the primary concern of the interlocutor. However, the reliability of the data and it's ease of integration
into a particular context determine its usability and value in the decision-making process and its consistency as a parameter in a model. Transparency and 
reproducibility are key to the value of the observations.

### Practical application: There is a job that needs to be done

Access to the desired indicators should be as easy as possible for stakeholders. Here we include the cost in time to the end user to integrate these observations. Whether this a chart,
a table of values or summary of results or even an API call. Therefore, if the data is sufficient to the task at hand it will be reliable and consistent. Experiments should be reproducible
and the methods of aggregation and analysis should be transparent. Retrieving the desired indicators, should be intuitive and easy to understand.

## Sufficient data






Consequently, protocols have been developed, implemented and tested to monitor the litter in this zone. The administrative and scientific basis
for this project is the [The guide to monitoring marine litter in European Seas](https://www.eea.europa.eu/publications/guide-to-monitoring-marine-litter-in-european-seas). 
This guide is based on the [MSFD](https://ec.europa.eu/environment/marine/eu-coast-and-marine-policy/marine-strategy-framework-directive/index_en.htm) directives.

The Swiss Federal Office for the Environment (FOEN) has produced a series of reports separated by river basin and lake. The report also explores
analytical methods, feature variables, legal applications and reusability. All of this from the perspective of the end user or beach-goer. The variety of
objects found, in switzerland we have 228 different object classifications, 80% are plastic. If we look at our end user as rational, then 
they want to minimize their risk: they prefer trash free beaches. The Association for the Protection of Lake Geneva (ASL) has replicated the study at the
regional level [Plastock](https://asleman.org/).

We can summarize the context of our data sufficiency problem as a multivariate problem where the feature variables can be reliably and consistently
be defined as an agreed upon set of layers defined by SwissTopo [here](https://www.swisstopo.admin.ch/en/home.html). Which simply means that
we are asking what is the chance of finding an object or group of objects at a specific location given the surrounding environmental condtions.

### Definition: Sufficient data

Sufficient data is 




Of the plastic and metal objects we represent every
aspect of the economy. When it comes to plastics the European Union has adopted the principle of precaution. From the end user perspective, we want 
less garbage in our rivers and lakes. Nobody is asking for more plastic in the water.


developed a specific protocol for monitoring litter in the Swiss lakes and rivers. This protocol is called the [IQAASL](https://www.bafu.admin.ch/bafu/fr/home/themes/dechets/dossiers/des-dechets-aux-abords-des-lacs-et-cours-d-eau-suisses.html). The protocol is based on the [MSFD](https://ec.europa.eu/environment/marine/eu-coast-and-marine-policy/marine-strategy-framework-directive/index_en.htm) and [Ospar](https://www.ospar.org/) directives. The protocol is implemented by the [ASL](https://asleman.org/).
