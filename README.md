# Project 2025

Project 2025 is a national inventory of plastics in the environment. An inventory is the systematic identification and 
quantification of anthropogenic items found in a specific location. The national inventory is composed of approximately
400 individual samples taken from select locations along rivers and lakes, call this a beach-litter-inventory.

The first report proved that a relatively small team could cover a large territory with the correct technology. 
This remains the case. That is why we see this project, in its current itteration, specifically attractive to stakeholders 
with an internal data-science team. Stakeholders with experience in python or R will feel right at home in the development environment 
and will be the source of many improvements. For those interested in learning the basics, we are here to 
coach them and help them in their projects.

## Reporting

The challenge in front of us is to transform the observations into accurate and actionable information for two different purposes. 
There is the administration of the territory and identification of priorities with regard to plastics in the environment. 
Then, once the priorities have been established these new indicators must be reported on. This project concerns the 
infrastructure and processes necessary to identify priorities and develop indicators to reduce plastics in the 
environment from litter density counts.

## Forecasting 

The inventory data is used to forecast the density of litter based on historical results and topographic features within 
1 500 m of each survey location.
