This is an application of large language models (llms) and machine learning to provide summary reports of volunteer observations
of marine litter using the OSPAR, JRC or NOAA methods for counting beach litter. 

The application provides summary reports of exising data and provides forecasts for a region, city or body of water. The  llm 
acts first as a transcriber of test results and then as an assistant to provide a written report and resource package that can
be either used directly or integrated into other documents.

This application minimizes the cost of reporting and evaluating beach litter density and uses geospatial analysis to leverage
the use of data from other disparate locations. Most importantly, decision makers and stakeholders have access to reliable, 
readable reports that allow them to communicate effectively and make informed decisions. 

The data in these reports is a combination of observations from variety of groups in Switerland since 2015. The observations were recorded using an interpretation of the _Guide for Monitoring Marine Litter on European Seas_ [The guide](https://mcc.jrc.ec.europa.eu/main/dev.py?N=41&O=439&titre_chap=TG%20Litter&titre_page=Guidance%20for%20the%20Monitoring%20of%20Marine%20Litter). The guide and the monitoring of beach litter are part of decades of research, here is the brief history [A Brief History of Marine Litter Research](https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-319-16510-3_1).
