# Proposal

The challenge in front of us is to transform the observations into accurate and actionable information for two different purposes. There is the 
administration of the territory and identification of priorities with regard to plastics in the environment. Then, once the priorities have been established these 
new indicators must be reported on. This project concerns the infrastructure and processes necessary to identify priorities and develop indicators to reduce plastics 
in the environment from litter density counts.

Therefore, we propose a harmonised reporting system that is administered by regional or national NGOS in collaboration with an academic partner with 
the stated goal of producing reliable reports for the public administration and others who communicate on such matters. This allows administrations to 
identify priorities and set baseline values according to agreed upon and observed indicators. 

The first report proved that a relatively small team could cover a large territory with the correct technology. This remains the case. 
That is why we see this project, in its current iteration, specifically attractive to stakeholders with an internal data-science team. 
Stakeholders with experience in python or R will feel right at home in the development environment and will be the source of many improvements. 
For those interested in learning the basics, we are here to coach them and help them in their projects.

The proposal is thus to establish a hub that is dedicated to the collection, cleaning, aggregating and distribution of litter density data. 
The distribution of the data has the primary goal of producing decision support products to local administrations and other organizations charged with 
reducing plastics in the environment. The _hub_ is staffed by three people and who conduct surveys, produce value added research, teach other 
NGOs to collect samples, and respond to requests from local administrations. Activities or changes in protocol are considered in consultation with academic advising team. 

## Goals

> * Develop a reporting and research tool for stakeholders in the waste management, life cycle assessment and environmental monitoring sectors.
> * Increase capacity of stakeholders to monitor and report observations according to the current standard in the federal report using open source tools.
> * Assist in the reduction and prevention of plastics in the environment

:::{dropdown} Objectives
1. Collect 400 - 500 samples in a 12 month period
   * reduce the number of items reported as _fragmented_ or _Gfrags_ 
     1. This value can range from 20% - 30% of the total items collected
   * include polymer identification for a subset of samples
     1. Subset should support an academic publication
     2. Subset should support a regional assessment of polymer types
   * Increase knowledge sharing between surveyors
   * Capacity building for surveyors
   
2. Increase the number of associations competent to collect and report data
   * Develop one association on Lac de Constance or Zurichsee
   * Develop training materials and protocols with ASL 

3. Structure report specifically for cantonal and municipal reporting
   * Revise and improve the current report
   * Consider the format of the report given cantonal requirements (attached) 

4. Build upon previous research and reports
   * Continue to develop modeling and parameter estimation for litter density
   * Focus on topographical features and densities
   * Consider polymer types and densities

5. Define groups of objects of interest with stakeholders
   * single use plastics
   * agricultural plastics
   * construction plastics
   * industrial plastics

6. Develop a cloud first infrastructure and chat agent
   * Move all data and software assets to Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS)
   * Develop machine learning and artificial intelligence pipelines for data analysis
   * Develop Automated programming interfaces (APIs) for data collection and reporting
   * Develop a user interface for data collection and reporting
   * Deploy chat agent
